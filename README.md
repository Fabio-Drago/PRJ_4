This is just a simple java program that i'm using to get better skills, getting better, adding new functions, etc.

**"What it does?"**

A: Well, it's just a simple program that allows the user to do easy operations, it has a simple menu, it's going to be more complex, for now i will use it for learning purposes

ðŸ’« Here's a simple roadmap of what i must achieve or try:

--- Menu System: Implement a menu system using switch or if-else statements to allow the user to choose different options.

--- Addition Functionality: Implement a function to perform addition of two numbers entered by the user.

--- Subtraction Functionality: Implement a function to perform subtraction of two numbers entered by the user.

--- Multiplication Functionality: Implement a function to perform multiplication of two numbers entered by the user.

--- Division Functionality: Implement a function to perform division of two numbers entered by the user. Be sure to handle division by zero.

--- Area Calculation Functionality: Add functionality to calculate the area of common shapes like squares, rectangles, circles, etc.

--- Volume Calculation Functionality: Add functionality to calculate the volume of common 3D shapes like cubes, cylinders, spheres, etc.

--- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to handle invalid inputs from the user, such as non-numeric input for numerical operations.

--- User Input Validation: Validate user input to ensure it meets certain criteria, such as being within a certain range for numerical operations.

--- Improved User Interface: Enhance the user interface to provide clearer instructions and feedback to the user.
